# Dinosaur Planet: Recompiled Mods
A collection of Dinosaur Planet: Recompiled mods.

> [!TIP]
> If you would like to create your own mods, consider starting with [the official mod template](https://github.com/Francessco121/dino-recomp-mod-template) instead.

## Mods
- [mod_fs](./mod_fs/) - A library providing APIs for replacing and adding assets via the game's filesystem.
- [shinx121_misc](./shinx121_misc/) - Various mods of mine that are either experiments or haven't been made into their own dedicated mods yet. Install at your own discretion, this mod is much less tested.

## Building
To compile these mods yourself, please see [the build guide](./BUILDING.md).
