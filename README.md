# Dinosaur Planet: Recompiled - Mods
A collection of Dinosaur Planet: Recompiled mods.

> [!TIP]
> If you would like to create your own mods, consider starting with [the official mod template](https://github.com/DinosaurPlanetRecomp/dino-recomp-mod-template) instead.

## Mods
- [extfs](./extfs/) - A library providing APIs for replacing and modifying content in the game's filesystem.
- [shinx121_debug](./shinx121_debug/) - Expands the debug menu with additional tools.
- [shinx121_misc](./shinx121_misc/) - Various mods of mine that are either experiments or haven't been made into their own dedicated mods yet. Install at your own discretion, this mod is much less tested.
- [shinx121_noclip](./shinx121_noclip/) - Allows the player to noclip!

## Building
To compile these mods yourself, please see [the build guide](./BUILDING.md).
